Our CSE 165 project. This is an object oriented side scroller game influenced by the hit TV show Rick and Morty

Restart Screen now Included

Welcome to our Rick and Morty game. We developed this game on Xcode using the SFML library. It might be a bit tricky to run this on your computer if you don’t have Xcode or the SFML libraries installed but we’ll try our best to explain how we ran it on our computers.

First of all you'll need a macbook and Xcode downloaded and installed for this to work.
Then you will need to install the SFML library. This youtube video does a great job explaining it.

We ran into small security & privacy permission issues when we tried to integrate the SFML Library. Once you follow the video and try to run the program it will not run. This is because you need to give permission to the libraries to work on your macbook. To fix these issues you need to give permission to the libraries that SFML is trying to run. You do this by going to System Preferences->  Security & Privacy -> General  and allow the library to run. You’ll need to do this around 15 times because you need to give permission to each library found in SFML. Once you successfully do this the sample app that SFML gives you should run.

You have successfully got the SFML library to work.

Now you can open our project folder using Xcode and our app should run successfully.
